        Machine Learning Fundamentals

        Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on
        algorithms that can learn from data. The main categories include supervised
        learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

        Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex
        patterns in data.

        Popular machine learning algorithms include:
        - Linear regression for predicting continuous values
        - Decision trees for classification and regression
        - Random forests for ensemble learning
        - Support vector machines for classification
        - Neural networks for complex pattern recognition

        Applications of machine learning span across many domains:
        - Computer vision for image recognition
        - Natural language processing for text analysis
        - Recommendation systems for personalized content
        - Autonomous vehicles for self-driving cars
        - Medical diagnosis for disease detection
